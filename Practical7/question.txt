Are there places in the World where there have been more than 10,000 total infections(as of 31 March)?
If so, where are they?

We can find that most of the countries with more than 10,000 cases are developed countries.
This may be due to the greater mobility of the population in developed countries and
the fact that they have the capacity to carry out large-scale nucleic acid testing.
